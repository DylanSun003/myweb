                smart (stylized as smart)[1] is a German automotive brand and 
                division of Daimler AG. The marque is based in BÃ¶blingen,
                Germany. It produces microcars and subcompacts, primarily 
                the Fortwo and Forfour. The primary assembly plant is the 
                Smartville in Hambach, France. Renault-owned Revoz, based 
                in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, has also assembled Smart vehicles. 
                mart is marketed in 46[2] countries around the world, and 
                production of the Fortwo had surpassed 1.7 million units by 
                early 2015.
                The design concept for the marque's automobiles began at
                Mercedes-Benz in the early-1970s to late-1980s. 
                After brief backing by Volkswagen, the first model 
                was released by Daimler-Benz in October 1998. Several 
                variants on the original design have been introduced, 
                with the original being the "Fortwo".
                In March 2019, Geely and Daimler AG announced the creation 
                of an equally owned global joint venture called the Smart 
                Automobile Co., Ltd.,[7][8] aimed at producing Smart-badged 
                cars in China to be marketed globally.[9]
